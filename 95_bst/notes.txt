HW95-- Algorithm as Data Structure

time spent: 1.5h

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1) a perfect binary tree has 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 ...2^h nodes

2) at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(L-1) nodes

3) height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceil(logn)-1 



DISCO:
* You can get away with no privacy specification (even though vscode was yelling at us 
  for a while)
* The height of a perfect tree is the  number of digits when 
  you convert # of nodes in a perfect tree into binary 
  (7 -> 111 -> h = 3 or 15 -> 1111 -> h = 4)

QCC:
* When we didn't use println in the pre order traveral method, it 
  didn't print out...but when we used println it worked...why??
* When do you need to import a java file inorder to use it? We think 
  it's when the file is not in the same folder you're trying to access 
  it from. 
* What value should the BST() constructor set _root's cargo to?
* How can we optimize our insert method to be more concise?
