DISCO:
    -Both the object declaration AND the initialization for the ArrayList and LinkedList needed to be parameterized with <PANCAKE>. 
     We initially only had the parameter on the initialization, and so a PANCAKE type wouldn't be returned in our methods.
  

QCC:
    -Would we ever need an isFull() method?
    -Is an ALStack or LLStack better from a time complexity standpoint?
